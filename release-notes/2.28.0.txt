NEW:

- Added subtitle color and position options

- AAC audio streams are no longer automatically converted to AC3, EAC3, or DTS during Direct Stream or Transcode when the related Settings > Audio setting is enabled. Instead they will play without conversion

FIXED:

- Fixed loss of focus when going to an empty web shows page
- Fixed navigation order after switching to the admin user
- Fixed News and Podcasts directories so they don't touch navigation bar
- Fixed extended info poster not positioned properly
